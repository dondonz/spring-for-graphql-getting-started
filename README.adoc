= Building a GraphQL service with Spring for GraphQL

This guide walks you through the process of creating a GraphQL service in Java using https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring for GraphQL].

== What You Will Build
You will build a service that will accept GraphQL requests at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

== What You Need

== Starting with Spring Initializr

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Choose Spring Boot 3.x
. Choose at least Java 17 (minimum requirement for Spring Boot 3.x)
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring for GraphQL* and *Spring Web*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a GraphQL application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from https://github.com/spring-guides/graphql-server[GitHub] and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== A very short introduction to GraphQL
// dz todo review - see what is the minimum

GraphQL is a query language to retrieve data from a server.
It is an alternative to REST, SOAP, or gRPC.

In this tutorial, we will query the details for a specific book from an online store backend.

This is how to send a GraphQL query to the server to retrieve details for the book with id "book-1":

[,graphql]
----
query bookDetails {
  bookById(id: "book-1"){
    id
    name
    pageCount
    author {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
----

This GraphQL query says:

* query a book with a specific id
* retrieve the id, name, pageCount and author from that book
* for the author, I want to know the firstName and lastName

The response is JSON:

[,json]
----
{
  "bookById": {
    "id":"book-1",
    "name":"Effective Java",
    "pageCount":416,
    "author": {
      "firstName":"Joshua",
      "lastName":"Bloch"
    }
  }
}
----

One very important property of GraphQL is that it is statically typed: the server knows exactly the shape of every object you can query and any client can actually "introspect" the server and ask for the "schema".
The schema describes what queries are possible and what fields you can get back.
(Note: when we refer to schema here, we always refer to a "GraphQL Schema", which is not related to other schemas like "JSON Schema" or "Database Schema")

The schema for the above query looks like this:

[,graphql]
----
type Query {
  bookById(id: ID): Book
}

type Book {
  id: ID
  name: String
  pageCount: Int
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  id: ID
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}
----

This tutorial will focus on how to implement a GraphQL server with this schema in Java.

We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with GraphQL.
Further information can be found on the https://graphql.org/learn/[official GraphQL page].

== GraphQL Java Overview

// dz todo review - and maybe chop
https://www.graphql-java.com[GraphQL Java] is the Java (server) implementation for GraphQL.
There are several repositories in the GraphQL Java Github org.
The most important one is the https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java[GraphQL Java Engine] which is the basis for everything else.

The GraphQL Java Engine is only concerned with executing queries.
It doesn't deal with any HTTP or JSON related topics.
For these aspects, we will use https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring for GraphQL] which takes care of exposing our API via Spring Boot over HTTP.

The main steps of creating a GraphQL Java server are:

. Defining a GraphQL Schema.
. Deciding on how the actual data for a query is fetched.

== Our example API: getting book details

Our example app will be a simple API to get details for a specific book. It is not intended to be a comprehensive API.

== Create a Spring Boot app
// dz todo review
Spring for GraphQL adds many useful features including loading schema files, initializing GraphQL Java, and simplifying data fetching with controller annotations.

== Schema

Create a directory `src/main/resources/graphql`.

Add a new file `schema.graphqls` to `src/main/resources/graphql` with the following content:

[,graphql]
----
type Query {
  bookById(id: ID): Book
}

type Book {
  id: ID
  name: String
  pageCount: Int
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  id: ID
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}
----

This schema defines one top level field (in the type `Query`):  `bookById` which returns the details of a specific book.

It also defines the type `Book` which has the fields: `id`, `name`, `pageCount` and `author`.
`author` is of type `Author`, which is defined after `Book`.

NOTE: The Domain Specific Language used above to describe a schema is called the Schema Definition Language or SDL. See more details in the https://graphql.org/learn/schema/[GraphQL documentation].

== Source of the data

A key strength of GraphQL is that data can be sourced from anywhere. Data can come from a database, an external service, or a static in-memory list.

To simplify the tutorial, book and author data will come from static lists inside their respective classes.

=== Create the Book class

Add the following to `bookDetails/Book.java`

// dz todo: make this a record
[,java]
----
public class Book {

    private String id;
    private String name;
    private int pageCount;
    private String authorId;

    public Book(String id, String name, int pageCount, String authorId) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.pageCount = pageCount;
        this.authorId = authorId;
    }

    private static List<Book> books = Arrays.asList(
            new Book("book-1", "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", 223, "author-1"),
            new Book("book-2", "Moby Dick", 635, "author-2"),
            new Book("book-3", "Interview with the vampire", 371, "author-3")
    );

    public static Book getById(String id) {
        return books.stream().filter(book -> book.getId().equals(id)).findFirst().orElse(null);
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getAuthorId() {
        return authorId;
    }
}
----

=== Create the Author class

Add the following to `bookDetails/Author.java`

// dz todo: convert to a record
// dz todo: change to different books - Effective Java, Down Under by Bill Bryson, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
[,java]
----
public class Author {

    private String id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    public Author(String id, String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.id = id;
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    private static List<Author> authors = Arrays.asList(
            new Author("author-1", "Joanne", "Rowling"),
            new Author("author-2", "Herman", "Melville"),
            new Author("author-3", "Anne", "Rice")
    );

    public static Author getById(String id) {
        return authors.stream().filter(author -> author.getId().equals(id)).findFirst().orElse(null);
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
----

== Adding code to fetch data

Spring for GraphQL provides an https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#controllers[annotation-based programming model] to declare handler methods to fetch the data for specific GraphQL fields.

Add the following to `bookDetails/BookController.java`

[,java]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {
    @QueryMapping
    public Book bookById(@Argument String id) {
        return Book.getById(id);
    }

    @SchemaMapping
    public Author author(Book book) {
        return Author.getById(book.getAuthorId());
    }
}
----

The `@QueryMapping` annotation binds this method to a query, a field under the Query type.
The query field is then determined from the method name, `bookById`.
It could also be declared on the annotation.
Spring for GraphQL uses `RuntimeWiring.Builder` to register the handler method as a `graphql.schema.DataFetcher` for the query field `bookById`.

In the GraphQL Java engine, `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to a map of field-specific argument values.
Use the `@Argument` annotation to have an argument bound to a target object and injected into the handler method.
By default, the method parameter name is used to look up the argument.
The argument name can be specified in the annotation.

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation maps a handler method to a field in the GraphQL schema and declares it to be the `DataFetcher` for that field.
The field name defaults to the method name, and the type name defaults to the simple class name of the source/parent object injected into the method.
In this example, the field defaults to `author` and the type defaults to `Book`.
The type and field can be specified in the annotation.

For more, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#controllers[documentation for the Spring for GraphQL annotated controller feature].

That's all the code we need!

Let's run our first query.

== Running our first query

=== Enable the GraphiQL Playground

GraphiQL is a useful visual interface for writing and executing queries, and much more.
Enable GraphiQL by adding this config to the `application.properties` file.

----
spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true
----

=== Boot the application

Start your Spring application.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/graphiql or your custom URL.

=== Run the query

Type in the query and hit the play button at the top of the window.

[,graphql]
----
query bookDetails {
  bookById(id: "book-1") {
    id
    name
    pageCount
    author {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
----
